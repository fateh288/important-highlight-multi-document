Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[1] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[2] â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions or decisions,[3]:2 through building a model from sample inputs.Machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the learning signal or feedback available to a learning system. 
These are[13]Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a teacher, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
