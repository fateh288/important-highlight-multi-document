Before announcing hispresidential candidacy, Obama began a well-publicized effort to quitsmoking. "I've never been a heavy smoker," he told the ChicagoTribune. "I've quit periodically over the last several years.<mark> I've got anironclad demand from my wife that in the stresses of the campaign Idon't succumb</mark>. I've been chewing Nicorette strenuously.<mark>"Obama was elected to the Illinois State Senate in 1996 from thestate's 13th District in the south-side Chicago neighborhood of HydePark</mark>.<mark> In 2000, he made an unsuccessful Democratic primary run forthe U</mark>.S.<mark> House of Representatives seat held by four-term incumbentcandidate Bobby Rush</mark>.<mark> He was overwhelmingly reelected to theIllinois Senate in 1998 & 2002, officially resigning in November 2004,following his election to the U</mark>.S. Senate.<mark> Among his majoraccomplishments as a state legislator, Obama's U</mark>.S. Senate web sitePage 3 of 18Biography of Barack Obamalists: "creating programs like the state Earned Income Tax Credit";"an expansion of early childhood education"; & "legislation requiringthe videotaping of interrogations & confessions in all capital cases."Reviewing Obama's career in the Illinois Senate, a February 2007article in the Washington Post noted his work with both Democrats &Republicans in drafting bipartisan legislation on ethics & health carereform.<mark> During his 2004 U</mark>.S. Senate campaign, Obama won theendorsement of the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police, whose officialscited his "longtime support of gun control measures & his willingnessto negotiate compromises," despite his support for some bills thepolice union had opposed. He was also criticized by a rival pro-choicecandidate in the Democratic primary & by his Republican pro-lifeopponent in the general election for having voted either "present" or"no" on anti-abortion legislation.Obama wrote & delivered the keynote address at the 2004Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts, while stillserving as a state legislator. After describing his maternalgrandfather's experiences as a World War II veteran & a beneficiaryof the New Deal's FHA & G.I. Bill programs, Obama said:No, people don't expect government to solve all their problems.But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change inpriorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decentshot at life, & that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. Theyknow we can do better.<mark> & they want that choice</mark>.Questioning the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War,Obama spoke of an enlisted Marine, Corporal Seamus Ahern fromPage 4 of 18Biography of Barack ObamaEast Moline, Illinois, asking, "Are we serving Seamus as well as he isserving us?" He continued:When we send our young men & women into harm's way, wehave a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truthabout why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone,to tend to the soldiers upon their return, & to never, ever go to warwithout enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, & earn therespect of the world.<mark>The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States &Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats</mark>.<mark>But I've got news for them too</mark>.

In early opinion polls leading up to theDemocratic primary, Obama trailed multimillionaire businessman BlairHull & Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes. However, Hull's popularitydeclined following allegations of domestic abuse. Obama's candidacywas boosted by an advertising campaign featuring images of the latePage 5 of 18Biography of Barack ObamaChicago Mayor Harold Washington & the late U.S. Senator PaulSimon; the support of Simon's daughter; & political endorsements bythe Chicago Tribune & Chicago Sun-Times. Obama received over52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead ofhis nearest Democratic rival. His opponent in the general electionwas expected to be Republican primary winner Jack Ryan. However,Ryan withdrew from the race in June 2004, following public disclosureof child custody divorce records containing sexual allegations byRyan's ex-wife, actress Jeri Ryan. In August 2004, with less thanthree months to go before election day, Alan Keyes accepted theIllinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. A long-timeresident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois withthe nomination. Through three televised debates, Obama & Keyesexpressed opposing views on stem cell research, abortion, guncontrol, school vouchers, & tax cuts. In the November 2004 generalelection, Obama received 70% of the vote to Keyes's 27%.<mark>Obama was sworn in as a Senator on January 4, 2005</mark>.

Tom Coburn (R-OK), Obama successfully introduced twoinitiatives bearing his name. "Lugar-Obama" expands the Nunn-Lugarcooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons,including shoulder-fired missiles & anti-personnel mines. The"Coburn-Obama Transparency Act" provides for a web site, managedby the Office of Management & Budget, listing all organizationsreceiving Federal funds from 2007 onward, & providing breakdownsby the agency allocating the funds, the dollar amount given, & thepurpose of the grant or contract.

Obama's energy initiatives scored pluses &minuses with environmentalists, who welcomed his sponsorship withSen. John McCain (R-AZ) of a climate change bill to reducegreenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds by 2050, but were skepticalof Obama's support for a bill promoting liquefied coal production. Alsoduring the first month of the 110th Congress, Obama introduced the"Iraq War De-Escalation Act," a bill that caps troop levels in Iraq atJanuary 10, 2007 levels, begins phased redeployment on May 1,2007, & removes all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31, 2008.<mark>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar(R-IN) & Committee member Barack Obama at a Russian base,where mobile launch missiles are being destroyed by the Nunn-Lugarprogram</mark>. During the August recess of 2005, Obama traveled withSen. Richard Lugar (R-IN), Chairman of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee, to Russia, Ukraine & Azerbaijan. The trip focused onstrategies to control the world's supply of conventional weapons,biological weapons, & weapons of mass destruction, as a strategicfirst defense against the threat of future terrorist attacks.

InUkraine, they toured a disease control & prevention facility &witnessed the signing of a bilateral pact to secure biologicalpathogens & combat risks of infectious disease outbreaks fromnatural causes or bioterrorism.<mark>Page 9 of 18Biography of Barack ObamaIn January 2006, Obama joined a Congressional delegation formeetings with U</mark>.S. military in Kuwait & Iraq. After the visits, Obamatraveled to Jordan, Israel, & the Palestinian territories. While in Israel,Obama met with Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom. Obama alsomet with a group of Palestinian students two weeks before Hamaswon the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election.<mark> ABC News 7(Chicago) reported Obama telling the students that "the U</mark>.S. willnever recognize winning Hamas candidates unless the grouprenounces its fundamental mission to eliminate Israel," & that he hadconveyed the same message in his meeting with Palestinian authorityPresident Mahmoud Abbas.Obama left for his third official trip in August 2006, traveling toSouth Africa & Kenya, & making stops in Djibouti, Ethiopia & Chad.He flew his wife & two daughters from Chicago to join him in a visit tohis father's birthplace, a village near Kisumu in rural western Kenya.Enthusiastic crowds greeted Obama's public appearances. In a publicgesture aimed to encourage more Kenyans to undergo voluntary HIVtesting, Obama & his wife took HIV tests at a Kenyan clinic. In anationally televised speech at the University of Nairobi, he spokeforcefully on the influence of ethnic rivalries & corruption in Kenya.The speech touched off a public debate among rival leaders, someformally challenging Obama's remarks as unfair & improper, othersdefending his positions.Obama drew a crowd of over 20,000 attendees at a AustinTexas, appearance.<mark> In February 2007, standing before the Old StateCapitol building in Springfield, Illinois, Obama announced hisPage 10 of 18Biography of Barack Obamacandidacy for the 2008 U</mark>.S.<mark> presidential election</mark>. Describing hisworking life in Illinois, & symbolically linking the event to AbrahamLincoln's 1858 House Divided speech, he said: "That is why, in theshadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on ahouse divided to stand together, where common hopes & commondreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacyfor President of the United States of America."The announcement followed months of speculation on whetherObama would run in 2008. Speculation intensified in October 2006when Obama first said he had "thought about the possibility" ofrunning for president, departing from earlier statements that heintended to serve out his six-year Senate term through 2010.Following Obama's statement, opinion polling organizations addedhis name to surveyed lists of Democratic candidates. The first suchpoll, taken in November 2006, ranked Obama in second place with17% support among Democrats after Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) whoplaced first with 28% of the responses.Through the fall of 2006, Obama had spoken at political eventsacross the country in support of Democratic candidates for themidterm elections. In September 2006, he was the featured speakerat Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's annual steak fry, an event traditionallyattended by presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the Iowa caucus.<mark>In December 2006, Obama spoke at a New Hampshire eventcelebrating Democratic Party midterm election victories in the first-inthe-nation U</mark>.S.<mark> presidential primary state</mark>.<mark> Addressing a meeting ofthe Democratic National Committee one week before announcing hisPage 11 of 18Biography of Barack Obamacandidacy, Obama called on Democrats to steer clear of negativecampaigning, saying: "This can't be about who digs up moreskeletons on who, who makes the fewest slip-ups on the campaigntrail</mark>. We owe it to the American people to do more than that.<mark>"Obama's campaign reported raising US$25</mark>.8 million betweenJanuary 1 & March 31 of 2007. The donations came from 104,000individual donors, with US$6.9 million raised through the Internet from50,000 of the donors. US$24.8 million of Obama's first quarter fundscan be used in the primaries, the highest of any 2008 presidentialcandidate. In early May 2007, the U.S. Secret Service announcedthat Obama had been placed under their protection. The protectionwas not in response to any specific threat, but the campaign hadreceived "hate mail, calls & other 'threatening materials'" in the past,& officials felt that the large crowds & increased campaign activitywarranted the order.On the role of government in economic affairs, Obama haswritten: "we should be asking ourselves what mix of policies will leadto a dynamic free market & widespread economic security,entrepreneurial innovation & upward mobility [...] we should be guidedby what works.<mark>" Speaking before the National Press Club in April2005, Obama defended the New Deal social welfare policies ofFranklin D</mark>. Roosevelt, associating Republican proposals to establishprivate accounts for Social Security with Social Darwinism. In a May2006 letter to President Bush, he joined four other Midwest farmingstate Senators in calling for the preservation of a US$0.54 per gallontariff on imported ethanol. Obama spoke out in June 2006 againstPage 12 of 18Biography of Barack Obamamaking recent, temporary estate tax cuts permanent, calling the cutsa "Paris Hilton" tax break for "billionaire heirs & heiresses.<mark>"Speaking in November 2006 to members of Wake Up WalMart, a union-backed campaign group, Obama said: "You gotta payyour workers enough that they can actually not only shop at WalMart, but ultimately send their kids to college & save for retirement</mark>.<mark>"In January 2007, Obama spoke at an event organized by FamiliesUSA, a health care advocacy group</mark>. Obama said, "The time hascome for universal health care in America [...] I am absolutelydetermined that by the end of the first term of the next president, weshould have universal health care in this country." Obama went on tosay that he believed that it was wrong that forty-six million Americansare uninsured, noting that taxpayers already pay over 15 billiondollars annually to care for the uninsured.He was an early opponent of Bush administration policies onIraq. In the fall of 2002, during an anti-war rally at Chicago's FederalPlaza, Obama said:I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale &without strong international support will only fan the flames of theMiddle East, & encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of theArab world, & strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda. I am notopposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars. You want a fight,President Bush? Let's finish the fight with Bin Laden & al-Qaeda,through effective, coordinated intelligence, & a shutting down of thefinancial networks that support terrorism, & a homeland securityprogram that involves more than color-coded warnings.Page 13 of 18Biography of Barack ObamaSpeaking before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs inNovember 2006, he said: "The days of using the war on terror as apolitical football are over. [...<mark>] It is time to give Iraqis their countryback, & it is time to refocus America's efforts on the wider struggle yetto be won</mark>." In his speech Obama also called for a phased withdrawalof American troops starting in 2007, & an opening of diplomaticdialogue with Iraq's neighbors, Syria & Iran.Obama spoke about Iran's "uranium enrichment program" onMarch 2, 2007, stating that Iran's government is "a threat to all of us,"& that the US "should take no option, including military action, off thetable." However, he stated that the US's "primary means" of relatingto Iran should entail "sustained & aggressive diplomacy combinedwith tough sanctions."Obama began podcasting from his U.S. Senate web site in late2005.<mark> He has responded to & personally participated in onlinediscussions hosted on politically-oriented blog sites</mark>. In a June 2006podcast, Obama expressed support for telecommunicationslegislation to protect network neutrality on the Internet, saying: "It isbecause the Internet is a neutral platform that I can put out thispodcast & transmit it over the Internet without having to go throughany corporate media middleman. I can say what I want withoutcensorship or without having to pay a special charge.<mark> But the bigtelephone & cable companies want to change the Internet as weknow it</mark>."During his first year as a U.S.<mark> senator, in a move more typicallytaken after several years of holding high political office, ObamaPage 14 of 18Biography of Barack Obamaestablished a leadership political action committee, Hopefund, forchanneling financial support to Democratic candidates</mark>. Obamaparticipated in 38 fundraising events in 2005, helping to pull inUS$6.55 million for candidates he supports & his own 2010 reelection fund. The New York Times described Obama as "the prizecatch of the midterm campaign" because of his campaigning forfellow Democratic Party members running for election in the 2006midterm elections.<mark> Hopefund gave US$374,000 to federal candidatesin the 2006 election cycle, making it one of the top donors to federalcandidates for the year</mark>.<mark>Obama has encouraged Democrats to reach out toevangelicals & other religious people, saying, "if we truly hope tospeak to people where they’re at—to communicate our hopes &values in a way that’s relevant to their own—we cannot abandon thefield of religious discourse</mark>." In December 2006, Obama joined Sen.Sam Brownback (R-KS) at the "Global Summit on AIDS & theChurch" organized by church leaders Kay & Rick Warren. Togetherwith Warren & Brownback, Obama took an HIV test, as he had donein Kenya less than four months earlier. Obama encouraged "others inpublic life to do the same" to show "there is no shame in going for anHIV test." Before the conference, 18 pro-life groups published anopen letter stating, in reference to Obama's support for legal abortion:"In the strongest possible terms, we oppose Rick Warren's decisionto ignore Senator Obama's clear pro-death stance & invite him toSaddleback Church anyway.<mark>"Page 15 of 18Biography of Barack ObamaA theme of Obama's 2004 Democratic National Conventionkeynote address, & the title of his 2006 book, The Audacity of Hope,was inspired by a sermon by Rev</mark>. Jeremiah Wright, the pastor ofObama's church, Trinity United Church of Christ. In the book, Obamawrites that his religious convictions formed during his twenties, when,as a community organizer working with local churches, he came tounderstand "the power of the African American religious tradition tospur social change":It was because of these newfound understandings—thatreligious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking,disengage from the battle for economic & social justice, or otherwiseretreat from the world that I knew & loved—that I was finally able towalk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ one day & bebaptized. It came about as a choice & not an epiphany; the questionsI had did not magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross onthe South Side of Chicago, I felt God's spirit beckoning me. Isubmitted myself to His will, & dedicated myself to discovering Histruth.Obama's 1995 book, Dreams from My Father, is a memoir ofhis youth & early career. The book was reprinted in 2004 with a newpreface & an annex containing his 2004 Democratic Conventionkeynote speech. The audio book edition earned Obama the 2006Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. In December 2004,Obama signed a US$1.9 million contract for three books.<mark> The first,The Audacity of Hope, was published in October 2006</mark>. An Italiantranslation was published in April 2007, & a Spanish translation willPage 16 of 18Biography of Barack Obamabe published in June 2007. It has remained on the New York TimesBest Seller list for the 29 weeks since publication.Supporters & critics have likened Obama's popular image to acultural Rorschach test, a neutral persona on which people canproject their personal histories & aspirations. Obama's own selfnarrative reinforces what a May 2004 New Yorker magazine articledescribed as his "everyman" image. In Dreams from My Father, heties his maternal family history to possible Native American ancestors& distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, president of the southernConfederacy during the American Civil War.<mark> Speaking to an elderlyJewish audience during his 2004 campaign for U</mark>.S. Senate, Obamalinked the linguistic roots of his East African first name Barack to theHebrew word baruch, meaning "blessed." In an October 2006interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Obama highlighted thediversity of his extended family: "Michelle will tell you that when weget together for Christmas or Thanksgiving, it's like a little mini-UnitedNations," he said. "I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, & I'vegot relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher. We've got it all."Obama's rapid rise from Illinois state legislator to U.S.presidential candidate has attracted conflicting analyses amongcommentators challenged to align him with traditional socialcategories. In her January 2007 Salon article asserting that Obama"isn't black," columnist Debra Dickerson writes: "lumping us alltogether [with Obama] erases the significance of slavery & continuingracism while giving the appearance of progress.<mark>" Expressing a similarview, New York Daily News columnist Stanley Crouch wrote: "WhenPage 17 of 18Biography of Barack Obamablack Americans refer to Obama as 'one of us,' I do not know whatthey are talking about</mark>.<mark>" But in an October 2006 article titled "Obama:Black Like Me," British columnist Gary Younge describes Obama as"a black man who does not scare white people</mark>." Film critic DavidEhrenstein, writing in a March 2007 Los Angeles Times article, iffillycompares the cultural sources of candidate Obama's favorablepolling among whites to those of "magical negro" roles played byblack actors in Hollywood movies.Writing about Obama's political image in a March 2007Washington Post opinion column, Eugene Robinson characterizedhim as "the personification of both-and," a messenger who rejects"either-or" political choices, & could "move the nation beyond theculture wars" of the 1960s. Obama, who defines himself in TheAudacity of Hope as "a Democrat, after all," has been criticized for hispolitical actions by self-described progressive commentator DavidSirota, & complimented for his "Can't we all just get along?" mannerby conservative columnist George Will. But in a December 2006 WallStreet Journal editorial headlined "The Man from Nowhere," formerRonald Reagan speech writer Peggy Noonan advised Will & other"establishment" commentators to get "down from your tippy toes" &avoid becoming too quickly excited about Obama's still early politicalcareer. Agreeing with Obama's own assessment that "people projecttheir hopes on him," Noonan attributed some of Obama's popularityto "a certain unknowability."In 2008 November, Barack Obama was elected President ofthe USA. And the Rest is “History.”Page 18 of 18
