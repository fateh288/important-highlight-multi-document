Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. We might, forinstance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions,or to behave intelligently. The learning that is being done is always based on some sortof observations or data, such as examples (the most common case in this course), directexperience, or instruction. So in general, machine learning is about learning to do better inthe future based on what was experienced in the past.
