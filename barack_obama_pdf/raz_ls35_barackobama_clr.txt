Introduction
Every child dreams about growing up.
Some children know what they want to be
as adults. They may want to be artists or
musicians, or doctors or lawyers. Others have
no idea what they want to be. Some do not find
a direction for their life until they are adults.

This is the story
of just such a child.
Things happened in
his life that caused
him to doubt himself
and made him feel as
though he did not fit
in. He was bothered
by many things that
happened around
him. Over time,
those things helped
Barack Obama, future president
him discover his
purpose in life. He developed a strong desire
to change the practices that had made him feel
like an outsider. That desire led him to become
president of the United States of America.

Barry’s mother married a man from
Indonesia when Barry was six. The family left
Hawaii and moved to Indonesia, where his
half-sister was born. Barry attended school
in Indonesia for four years. He learned the
language and customs of his new country.
He also saw what it meant to be very poor.
Many Indonesian families struggled each day
just to have enough food to eat.

Growing Up
Barack Obama Jr.—called Barry during his
childhood—was born in 1961 in Hawaii. His
mother, Ann Dunham, was from the state of
Kansas. His father, Barack Obama Sr., was
from the country of Kenya, in eastern Africa.
His parents met and married while they were
students at the University of Hawaii. The
marriage did not last. By the time Barry turned
four, his parents had divorced and his father
had moved back to Kenya.

Barry sometimes felt strange being so far
from Hawaii. He felt he was not part of the
community where he now lived. He wondered
who he was and where he belonged in the
world. Having parents of different races and
from different continents caused him to
wonder and question even more.

While the family lived in Indonesia, Barry’s
mother began teaching him about race and
ethnicity. He learned about slavery and about
the civil rights movement in the United
States. Ann also
taught him about

Americans in politics,
history, music, culture,
and sports who

his racial heritage.
But Barry was confused. Although his
mother taught him about African American
leaders, he also learned about people who
were ashamed of the color of their skin. He
also learned about people who thought others
were wrong or ignorant just because of their
skin color or religion. Barry began to see that
race and ethnicity were complicated issues.
How could people feel pride when they were
being judged on the very things they were
proud of?

After four years in Indonesia, Barry’s
mother thought that he could receive a better
education back in the United States. So in
1971, when he was ten, she sent Barry back to
Hawaii to attend
school and to
live with his
grandparents.
Barry’s grandparents were

from high school.

Finding His Way
After he graduated
from high school in
Hawaii, Barry went to
college in Los Angeles.
During that time, he

treatment of black
people. Barry began to embrace his African
heritage and started using his Kenyan name,
Barack, which means “blessed.” He started
to understand that he didn’t have to choose
between his white and black backgrounds—
he was both.

By the time Barack finished college, he knew
he wanted to help people in communities. He
wanted to involve people in creating better
lives for themselves. He also wanted to see
local laws changed so people would receive
fair treatment. He found a job and moved
to Chicago in 1985. He became the director
of an organization that helped people in poor
neighborhoods find jobs and improve their lives.

Do You Know?

Before Barack moved to Chicago, he held a job
with a big business for a short time. He started earning
good money, but he was not happy. He hungered to
be involved in something bigger than his own life. He
quit his job and found one where he could help people.
Later he said, “There’s nothing wrong with making
money, but focusing your life [just] on making a buck
shows a poverty of ambition.”

Barack wanted to learn how laws and
government worked. He wanted to help
change some of the injustices he saw. In 1981,
he transferred to Columbia University in New
York City. He graduated in 1983 with a degree
in political science.

Barack’s work in Chicago fed his passion
for helping poor people. But through his work,
he saw that to make lasting changes, he would
need to learn how to change laws. He believed
that by changing unfair laws, communities
could improve the lives of their people.

Barack helped set up a job-training
program for African Americans who had lost
their jobs when factories closed. He also
helped call attention to a dangerous material
called asbestos that was in the walls of
buildings where many poor people lived. His
organization started a tutoring program to
help young people who wanted to go to
college. Barack also managed a program to
sign up new voters. He encouraged people to
get involved in politics so that fairer laws
could be passed.

After finishing law school, Barack moved
back to Chicago and worked for a law
company for the summer. A female lawyer
named Michelle Robinson advised him, and
they became friends. Barack invited Michelle
along when he went to visit some of the people
and communities he had helped in the 1980s.
Michelle was deeply moved by Barack’s vision
of a better world. She saw how much the
people he had worked with respected him.

Becoming a Politician
Barack had become a lawyer to help people.
But he soon saw that helping people as a
lawyer was a very slow process. He decided
that entering politics and changing laws would
be an even faster way to help. In 1996, he ran
for and won a seat in the Illinois state senate.
As a state senator, he helped change laws so
poor working families could pay lower taxes.
He also helped change laws so children would
have better education and health care.

Barack ran for the United States Senate in
2004. He was asked to speak at an important
meeting of the Democratic Party. He gave a
hopeful speech about all Americans working
together to help the United States become an
even greater country. The speech was a big
success, and Barack’s words inspired many
people. He easily won a seat in the U.S. Senate
later that year. Because of the speech, many
people encouraged Barack to run for
president—the biggest job in the United
States—in 2008.

“Tonight is a particular honor for me
because, let’s face it, my presence on this
stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a
foreign student, born and raised in a small
village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats,
went to school in a tin-roof shack …. [My]
mother … was born in a town on the other
side of the world, in Kansas ….
“My parents shared … an abiding faith
in the possibilities of this nation. They
would give me an African name, Barack, or
”blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America
your name is no barrier to success …. They
imagined me going to the best schools in the
land, even though they weren’t rich, because
in a generous America you don’t have to be
rich to achieve your potential ….
“I stand here today, grateful for the
diversity of my heritage, aware that my
parents’ dreams live on in my two precious
daughters. I stand here knowing that my
story is part of the larger American story …
and that in no other country on Earth is my
story even possible.”
— Barack Obama, Democratic National
Convention, July 27, 2004

Barack had to be convinced that being
president was the best thing for him and
his family. He thought that he did not have
enough experience as a U.S. senator. Barack
knew that, because he was African American,
running for president could be dangerous. He
knew that just running for president would
change his and his family’s lives forever. He
could no longer take a walk or get his hair cut
without drawing a crowd.
While he thought about whether or not to
run for president, Barack’s reputation grew.
The two books he had written inspired many
people to write to him and encourage him. He
continued to give speeches and talk to people.
Many more people became inspired by his
words, his clear thinking, his respect for all
people,
and his
belief in
peaceful
solutions
to big
problems.
Barack’s two books
are best sellers.

Conclusion
Barack began his job as president on
January 20, 2009. He, his wife Michelle, and
their two young daughters moved into the
White House in Washington, D.C. In October
2009, President Obama was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize in recognition of his efforts to make
the world a better and more peaceful place.
“Change will not come if we wait for some
other person or some other time. We are the
ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the
change that we seek.”
—Barack Obama
