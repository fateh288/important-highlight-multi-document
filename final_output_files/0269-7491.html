Emerging pollutions are of eminent interest, suchas microplastics, electronic wastes, light or noise pollution as long as they can clearly be related tothe biological effects mentioned above. Papers must be process-orientated and/or hypotheses-basedto be considered for population.<mark> Papers based on field studies are given priority for publication overmicro/meso cosmos studies</mark>.<mark>Papers, such as meta analyses, that report findings from re-examination and interpretation of existingdata are welcome</mark>.<mark> Modeling papers are welcome only to a certain extent, i</mark>.<mark>e</mark>.<mark>, they must be related toa specific pollution issue or process that is potentially of ecological and/or human health implications</mark>.<mark>Critical review papers and commentaries are also of high interest as are letters to the editor</mark>.<mark>The editors do not wish to publish papers that describe results from routine surveys and monitoringprograms that are primarily of local or regional interest</mark>.<mark> Descriptions of well-known pollutants,such as legacy pollutants, in yet another location are not of interest</mark>. Papers about sewage,waste and wastewater treatment and management as well as standard techniques in agronomy,remediation, biomonitoring, bioremediation and phytoremediation are not acceptable. However,papers on innovative techniques to combat regional or global problems are welcome; however,technical studies must show their field applicability.<mark>Furthermore, the editors discourage submission of papers which describe analytical methods,laboratory experiments, food science studies, screening of new plant/animal/microorganism speciesfor effect assessments and testing known pollution and chemicals in another setting</mark>. Eutrophicationstudies and secondary pollution by eutrophication are not covered by Environmental Pollution.<mark> In thesame line, papers on ocean enrichment by CO2 will not be accepted</mark>.<mark>The abstract (up to 300 words), highlights and conclusions of papers in this journal must containclear and concise statements</mark>.<mark> A graphical abstract is mandatory</mark>.
