<mark>Health & Environmental Effects of Air PollutionHealth EffectsAir pollution can harm us when it accumulates in the air in high enough concentrations</mark>.<mark>Millions of Americans live in areas where urban smog, particle pollution, and toxicpollutants pose serious health concerns</mark>.<mark> People exposed to high enough levels ofcertain air pollutants may experience:Irritation of the eyes, nose, and throatWheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and breathing difficultiesWorsening of existing lung and heart problems, such as asthmaIncreased risk of heart attackIn addition, long-term exposure to air pollution can cause cancer and damage to theimmune, neurological, reproductive, and respiratory systems</mark>. In extreme cases, it caneven cause death.<mark>Who Is Most at Risk?Air pollution is a problem for all of us</mark>.<mark> However, some groups of people are especiallysensitive to common air pollutants such as particulates and ground-level ozone</mark>.Sensitive populations include children, older adults, people who are active outdoors,and people with heart or lung diseases, such as asthma. If you are sensitive to airpollution, you need to be aware of steps you can take to protect your health.<mark>For more information on sensitive populations and the health effects of common airpollutants, check out our pollutant fact sheets</mark>.<mark>This information is available in alternate format</mark>.

Theseacids are formed primarily by nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides released into theatmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. These acids fall to the Earth either as wetprecipitation (rain, snow, or fog) or dry precipitation (gas and particulates). Some arecarried by the wind, sometimes hundreds of miles.<mark> In the environment, acid raindamages trees and causes soils and water bodies to acidify, making the waterunsuitable for some fish and other wildlife</mark>. It also speeds the decay of buildings,statues, and sculptures that are part of our national heritage.<mark> Acid rain has damagedMassachusetts lakes, ponds, rivers, and soils, leading to damaged wildlife and forests</mark>.<mark>For more information on acid rain, go to http://www</mark>.epa.gov/acidrain/.<mark>Eutrophication is a condition in a water body where high concentrations of nutrients(such as nitrogen) stimulate blooms of algae, which in turn can cause fish kills and lossof plant and animal diversity</mark>. Although eutrophication is a natural process in the aging oflakes and some estuaries, human activities can greatly accelerate eutrophication byincreasing the rate at which nutrients enter aquatic ecosystems. Air emissions ofnitrogen oxides from power plants, cars, trucks, and other sources contribute to theamount of nitrogen entering aquatic ecosystems.<mark>Haze is caused when sunlight encounters tiny pollution particles in the air</mark>. Hazeobscures the clarity, color, texture, and form of what we see.<mark> Some haze-causingpollutants (mostly fine particles) are directly emitted to the atmosphere by sources suchas power plants, industrial facilities, trucks and automobiles, and construction activities</mark>.Others are formed when gases emitted to the air (such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogenoxides) form particles as they are carried downwind.<mark> For more information on haze, visitthe U</mark>.S.<mark> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Visibility Web page:http://www</mark>.epa.gov/oar/visibility/.<mark>Effects on wildlife</mark>.<mark> Toxic pollutants in the air, or deposited on soils or surface waters,can impact wildlife in a number of ways</mark>. Like humans, animals can experience healthproblems if they are exposed to sufficient concentrations of air toxics over time. Studiesshow that air toxics are contributing to birth defects, reproductive failure, and disease inanimals.<mark> Persistent toxic air pollutants (those that break down slowly in theenvironment) are of particular concern in aquatic ecosystems</mark>. These pollutantsaccumulate in sediments and may biomagnify in tissues of animals at the top of the foodchain to concentrations many times higher than in the water or air.<mark>Ozone depletion</mark>. Ozone is a gas that occurs both at ground-level and in the Earth'supper atmosphere, known as the stratosphere.<mark> At ground level, ozone is a pollutant thatcan harm human health</mark>.<mark> In the stratosphere, however, ozone forms a layer that protectslife on earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays</mark>. But this "good" ozone isgradually being destroyed by man-made chemicals referred to as ozone-depletingsubstances, including chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and halons.These substances were formerly used and sometimes still are used in coolants,foaming agents, fire extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants.<mark>Thinning of the protective ozone layer can cause increased amounts of UV radiation toreach the Earth, which can lead to more cases of skin cancer, cataracts, and impairedimmune systems</mark>. UV can also damage sensitive crops, such as soybeans, and reducecrop yields.<mark>Crop and forest damage</mark>.<mark> Air pollution can damage crops and trees in a variety ofways</mark>.Ground-level ozone can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercialforest yields, reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased plantsusceptibility to disease, pests and other environmental stresses (such as harshweather). As described above, crop and forest damage can also result from acid rainand from increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion.<mark>Global climate change</mark>.<mark> The Earth's atmosphere contains a delicate balance ofnaturally occurring gases that trap some of the sun's heat near the Earth's surface</mark>.<mark> This"greenhouse effect" keeps the Earth's temperature stable</mark>. Unfortunately, evidence ismounting that humans have disturbed this natural balance by producing large amountsof some of these greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. As a result,the Earth's atmosphere appears to be trapping more of the sun's heat, causing theEarth's average temperature to rise - a phenomenon known as global warming.<mark> Manyscientists believe that global warming could have significant impacts on human health,agriculture, water resources, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas</mark>.
