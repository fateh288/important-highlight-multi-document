Flyash affects vegetation as a result of its direct deposition on leaf surfaces or indirectlythrough its deposition on soil. Fly ash is now being used for making bricks and as a land fillmaterial.• Lead and other metals particlesTetraethyl lead (TEL) is used as an anti-knock agent in petrol for smooth and easy runningof vehicles. The lead particles coming out from the exhaust pipes of vehicles is mixed withair. If inhaled it produces injurious effects on kidney and liver and interferes with developmentof red blood cells. Lead mixed with water and food can create cumulative poisoning. Ithas long term effects on children as it lowers intelligence.Oxides of iron, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, zinc and other metals have adverseeffect due to deposition of dust on plants during mining operations and metallurgicalprocesses. They create physiological, biochemical and developmental disorders in plantsand also contribute towards reproductive failure in plants.Table 10.2: Annual average concentration of pollutants in ambient air inresidential and industrial areas (year 2000) mg/m3 in 24 hoursSPM permissible- residential 140 – 200 mg/m3, industrial 360 – 500 mg/m3City166Residential areaIndustrial areaAgraBhopalDelhiKanpurKolkata349185368348218388160372444405Nagpur140157MODULE - 4Environmental PollutionContemporaryEnvironmental Issues10.3.<mark>2 Gaseous pollutantsPower plants, industries, different types of vehicles – both private and commercial usepetrol, diesel as fuel and release gaseous pollutants such as carbon dioxide, oxides ofnitrogen and sulphur dioxide along with particulate matter in the form of smoke</mark>.<mark> All ofthese have harmful effects on plants and humans</mark>.

In hospitals, pathogenspresent in waste remain in the air in the form of spores. This can result in hospital acquiredinfections and is an occupational health hazard. In congested areas, slums and rural areasburning of firewood and biomass results in lot of smoke. Children and ladies exposed tosmoke may suffer from acute respiratory problems which include running nose, cough,sore throat, lung infection, asthama, difficulty in breathing, noisy respiration and wheezing.<mark>(ii) Prevention and control of indoor air pollutionUse of wood and dung cakes should be replaced by cleaner fuels such as biogas, keroseneor electricity</mark>. But supply of electricity is limited. Similarly kerosene is also limited. Improvedstoves for looking like smokeless chullahs have high thermal efficiency and reduced emissionof pollutants including smoke. The house designs should incorporate a well ventilatedkitchen. Use of biogas and CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) need to be encouraged.Those species of trees such as baval (Acacia nilotica) which are least smoky should beplanted and used. Charcoal is a comparatively cleaner fuel.<mark> Indoor pollution due to decayof exposed kitchen waste can be reduced by covering the waste properly</mark>.<mark> Segregation ofwaste, pretreatment at source, sterilization of rooms will help in checking indoor air pollution</mark>.<mark>(iii) Prevention and control of industrial pollutionIndustrial pollution can be greatly reduced by:(a) use of cleaner fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) in power plants, fertilizerplants etc</mark>. which is cheaper in addition to being environmentally friendly.<mark>(b) employing environment friendly industrial processes so that emission of pollutants andhazardous waste is minimized</mark>.<mark>(c) installing devices which reduce release of pollutants</mark>.<mark> Devices like filters, electrostaticprecipitators, inertial collectors, scrubbers, gravel bed filters or dry scrubbers aredescribed below:(i) Filters – Filters remove particulate matter from the gas stream</mark>. The medium of a filtermay be made of fibrous materials like cloth, granular material like sand, a rigid materiallike screen, or any mat like felt pad. Baghouse filtration system is the most commonone and is made of cotton or synthetic fibres ( for low temperatures) or glass clothfabrics (for higher temperature up to 290oC).(ii) Electrostatic precipitators (ESP)- The emanating dust is charged with ions and theionized particulate matter is collected on an oppositely charged surface. The particles168Environmental Pollutionare removed from the collection surface by occasional shaking or by rapping thesurface. ESPs are used in boilers, furnaces, and many other units of thermal powerplants, cement factories, steel plants, etc.(iii) Inertial collectors – It works on the principle that inertia of SPM in a gas is higherthan its solvent and as inertia is a function of the mass of the particulate matter thisdevice collects heavier particles more efficiently. ‘Cyclone’ is a common inertial collectorused in gas cleaning plants.<mark>MODULE - 4ContemporaryEnvironmental IssuesNotes(iv) Scrubbers – Scrubbers are wet collectors</mark>.<mark> They remove aerosols from a stream ofgas either by collecting wet particles on a surface followed by their removal, or elsethe particles are wetted by a scrubbing liquid</mark>. The particles get trapped as they travelfrom supporting gaseous medium across the interface to the liquid scrubbing medium.<mark>Gaseous pollutants can be removed by absorption in a liquid using a wet scrubber anddepends on the type of the gas to be removed e</mark>.<mark>g</mark>. for removal of sulphur dioxide alkalinesolution is needed as it dissolves sulphur dioxide. Gaseous pollutants may be absorbed onan activated solid surface like silica gel, alumina, carbon, etc. Silica gel can remove watervapour. Condensation allows the recovery of many by products in coal and petroleumprocessing industries from their liquid effluents.Apart from the use of above mentioned devices, other control measures are•increasing the height of chimneys.<mark>•closing industries which pollute the environment</mark>.•shifting of polluting industries away from cities and heavily populated areas.•development and maintenance of green belt of adequate width.(iv) Control of vehicular pollution•The emission standards for automobiles have been set which if followed will reducethe pollution. Standards have been set for the durability of catalytic converters whichreduce vehicular emission.<mark>•In cities like Delhi, motor vehicles need to obtain Pollution Under Control (PUC)certificate at regular intervals</mark>.<mark> This ensures that levels of pollutants emitted from vehicleexhaust are not beyond the prescribed legal limits</mark>.•The price of diesel is much cheaper than petrol which promotes use of diesel. Toreduce emission of sulphurdioxide, sulphur content in diesel has been reduced to 0.05%.•Earlier lead in the form of tetraethyl lead was added in the petrol to raise octane levelfor smooth running of engines.<mark> Addition of lead in petrol has been banned to preventemission of lead particles with the vehicular emission</mark>.169MODULE - 4ContemporaryEnvironmental IssuesEnvironmental Science Senior Secondary CourseAlternate fuels like CNG is being encouraged for use in public transport vehicles.INTEXT QUESTIONS 10.1Notes1.<mark> Define pollutant and pollution</mark>.______________________________________________________________2.<mark> Name any three devices that control pollution</mark>.______________________________________________________________3.<mark> State two means of controlling indoor air pollution</mark>.______________________________________________________________4.<mark> What is a PUC certificate?______________________________________________________________10</mark>.<mark>4 OZONE HOLE-CAUSES AND HARM DUE TO OZONEDEPLETIONThe stratosphere has an ozone layer which protects the earth’s surface from excessiveultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun</mark>. Chlorine from chemicals such aschlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used for refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers,cleaning solvents, aerosols (spray cans of perfumes, medicine, insecticide) cause damageto ozone layer chlorine contained in the CFCs on reaching the ozone (O3) layer split theozone molecules to form oxygen (O2).<mark> Amount of ozone, thus gets reduced and cannotprevent the entry of UV radiation</mark>. There has been a reduction of ozone umbrella or shieldover the Arctic and Antarctic regions.<mark> This is known as ozone hole</mark>.<mark> This permits passageof UV radiation on earth’s atmosphere which causes sunburn, cataract in eyes leading toblindness, skin cancer, reduced productivity of forests, etc</mark>. Under the “Montreal Protocol”amended in 1990 it was decided to completely phase out CFCs to prevent damage ofozone layer.10.5 GLOBAL WARMING AND GREENHOUSE EFFECTAtmospheric gases like carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, andchlorofluorocarbons are capable of trapping the out-going infrared radiation from the earth.<mark>Infra-red radiations trapped by the earth’s surface cannot pass through these gases and toincrease thermal energy or heat in the atmosphere</mark>.<mark> Thus, the temperature of the globalatmosphere is increased</mark>.<mark> As this phenomenon of increase in temperature is observed in170MODULE - 4Environmental Pollutiongreen houses, in the botanical gardens these gases are known as green house gases andthe heating effect is known as green house effect</mark>. If greenhouse gases are not checked, bythe turn of the century the temperature may rise by 50C. This will melt the polar ice capsand increase the sea level leading to coastal flooding, loss of coastal areas and ecosystemslike swamps and marshes, etc.<mark>ContemporaryEnvironmental IssuesNotes10</mark>.<mark>6 NOISE POLLUTIONNoise is one of the most pervasive pollutant</mark>. A musical clock may be nice to listen duringthe day, but may be an irritant during sleep at night. Noise by definition is “sound withoutvalue” or “any noise that is unwanted by the recipient”. Noise in industries such as stonecutting and crushing, steel forgings , loudspeakers, shouting by hawkers selling their wares,movement of heavy transport vehicles, railways and airports leads to irritation and anincreased blood pressure, loss of temper, decrease in work efficiency, loss of hearingwhich may be first temporary but can become permanent in the noise stress continues. It istherefore of utmost importance that excessive noise is controlled.<mark> Noise level is measuredin terms of decibels (dB)</mark>. W.H.<mark>O</mark>. (World Health Organization) has prescribed optimumnoise level as 45 dB by day and 35 dB by night. Anything above 80 dB is hazardous.

In contrastnon-point sources include discharge of pollutants from diffused sources or from a largerarea such as run off from agricultural fields, grazing lands, construction sites, abandonedmines and pits, roads and streets.Notes10.7.<mark>1 Sources of water pollutionWater pollution is the major source of water born diseases and other health problems</mark>.<mark>Sediments brought by runoff water from agricultural fields and discharge of untreated orpartially treated sewage and industrial effluents, disposal of fly ash or solid waste into orclose to a water body cause severe problems of water pollution</mark>. Increased turbidity ofwater because of sediments reduces penetration of light in water that reduces photosynthesisby aquatic plants.<mark>(i) Pollution due to pesticides and inorganic chemicals•Pesticides like DDT and others used in agriculture may contaminate water bodies</mark>.<mark>Aquatic organisms take up pesticides from water get into the food chain (aquatic inthis case) and move up the food chain</mark>. At higher trophic level they get concentratedand may reach the upper end of the food chain.•Metals like lead, zinc, arsenic, copper, mercury and cadmium in industrial waste watersadversely affect humans and other animals. Arsenic pollution of ground water hasbeen reported from West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Western U.P. Consumption of sucharsenic polluted water leads to accumulation of arsenic in the body parts like blood,nails and hairs causing skin lesions, rough skin, dry and thickening of skin and ultimatelyskin cancer.<mark>•Pollution of water bodies by mercury causes Minamata disease in humans anddropsy in fishes</mark>.

Unlike terrestrial ecosystems, the temperatureof water bodies remain steady and does not change very much.<mark> Accordingly, aquaticorganisms are adopted to a uniform steady temperature of environment and any fluctuationin water temperature severely affects aquatic plants and animals</mark>.<mark> Hence discharge of hotwater from power plants adversely affects aquatic organisms</mark>. Aquatic plants and animalsin the warm tropical water live dangerously close to their upper limit of temperature,particularly during the warm summer months. It requires only a slight deviation from thislimit to cause a thermal stress to these organisms.<mark>Discharge of hot water in water body affects feeding in fishes, increases their metabolismand affects their growth</mark>.<mark> Their swimming efficiency declines</mark>. Running away from predatorsor chasing prey becomes difficult. Their resistance to diseases and parasites decreases.<mark>Due to thermal pollution biological diversity is reduced</mark>.<mark> One of the best methods of reducingthermal pollution is to store the hot water in cooling ponds, allow the water to cool beforereleasing into any receiving water body10</mark>.7.<mark>2 Ground water pollutionLot of people around the world depend on ground water for drinking, domestic, industrialand agricultural uses</mark>.<mark> Generally groundwater is a clean source of water</mark>.<mark> However, humanactivities such as improper sewage disposal, dumping of farm yard manures and agriculturalchemicals, industrial effluents are causing pollution of ground water</mark>.Fig. 10.<mark>2: Figure showing how the ground water gets polluted174Environmental Pollution10</mark>.7.3 EutrophicationMODULE - 4ContemporaryEnvironmental Issues• ‘Eu’ maens well or healthy and ‘trophy’ means nutrition.<mark> The enrichment of water bodieswith nutrients causes entrophication of the water body</mark>.<mark>Discharge of domestic waste, agricultural surface runoff, land drainage and industrial effluentsin a water body leads to rapid nutrients enrichment in a water body</mark>.<mark> The excessive nutrientenrichment in a water body encourages the growth of algae duckweed, water hyacinth,phytoplankton and other aquatic plants</mark>.The biological demand for oxygen (BOD) increaseswith the increase in aquatic organisms. As more plants grow and die, the dead and decayingplants and organic matter acted upon by heterotrophic prtozoans and bacteria, deplete thewater of dissolved oxygen (DO).<mark> Decrease in DO result in sudden death of large populationof fish and other aquatic organisms including plants, releasing offensive smell and makesthe water unfit for human use</mark>. The sudden and explosive growth of phytoplankton andalgae impart green colour to the water is known as water bloom, or “algal blooms”. Thesephytoplankton release toxic substances in water that causes sudden death of large populationof fishes.<mark> This phenomenon of nutrient enrichment of a water body is called eutrophication</mark>.<mark>Human activities are mainly responsible for the eutrophication of a growing number oflakes and water bodies in the countryNotes10</mark>.7.<mark>4 Methods for control of water pollution and water recyclingControl water pollutionWaste water from domestic or industrial sources or from garbage dumps is generallyknown as sewage</mark>.<mark> It may also contain rain water and surface runoff</mark>.<mark> The sewage watercan be treated to make it safe for disposal into water bodies like rivers, lakes etc</mark>.

The worse case of nuclear pollution was thecherndoyl disaster in Russia occured in 1986 but the effects still longer today.10.9.<mark>1 RadiationRadiation is a form of energy travelling through space</mark>.<mark> The radiation emanating from thedecay of radioactive nuclides are a major sources of radiation pollution</mark>.<mark> Radiations can becategorized into two groups namely the non-ionizing radiations and the ionizing radiations</mark>.Non-ionizing radiations are constituted by the electromagnetic waves at the longerwavelength of the spectrum ranging from near infra-red rays to radio waves.<mark> These waveshave energies enough to excite the atoms and molecules of the medium through which theypass, causing them to vibrate faster but not strong enough to ionize them</mark>.<mark> In a microwaveoven the radiation causes water molecules in the cooking medium to vibrate faster andthus raising its temperature</mark>.<mark>Ionizing radiations cause ionization of atoms and molecules of the medium through whichthey pass</mark>.<mark> Electromagnetic radiations such as short wavelength ultra violet radiations (UV),178Environmental PollutionX-rays and gamma rays and energetic particles produced in nuclear processes, electricallycharged particles like alpha and beta particles produced in radioactive decay and neutronsproduced in nuclear fission, are highly damaging to living organisms</mark>.<mark> Electrically chargedparticles produced in the nuclear processes can have sufficient energy to knock electronsout of the atoms or molecules of the medium, thereby producing ions</mark>. The ions producedin water molecules, for example, can induce reactions that can break bonds in proteinsand other important molecules. An example of this would be when a gamma ray passesthrough a cell, the water molecules near the DNA might be ionized and the ions might reactwith the DNA causing it to break. They can also cause chemical changes by breaking thechemical bonds, which can damage living tissues.<mark> The ionizing radiations cause damage tobiological systems and are, therefore, pollutants</mark>.<mark>MODULE - 4ContemporaryEnvironmental IssuesNotes10</mark>.9.<mark>2 Radiation damageThe biological damage resulting from ionizing radiations is generally termed as radiationdamage</mark>. Large amounts of radiation can kill cells that can dramatically affect the exposedorganism as well as possibly its offspring.<mark> Affected cells can mutate and result in cancer</mark>.<mark> Alarge enough dose of radiation can kill the organism</mark>.<mark>Radiation damage can be divided into two types: (a) somatic damage (also called radiationsickness) and (b) genetic damage</mark>.<mark> Somatic damage refers to damage to cells that arenot associated with reproduction</mark>. Effects of somatic radiation damage include reddeningof the skin, loss of hair, ulceration, fibrosis of the lungs, the formation of holes in tissue, areduction of white blood cells, and the induction of cataract in the eyes.<mark> This damage canalso result in cancer and death</mark>. Genetic damage refers to damage to cells associated withreproduction.<mark> This damage can subsequently cause genetic damage from gene mutationresulting in abnormalities</mark>.<mark> Genetic damages are passed on to next generation</mark>.10.9.<mark>3 Radiation doseThe biological damage caused by the radiation is determined by the intensity of radiationand duration of the exposure</mark>. It depends on the amount of energy deposited by the radiationin the biological system.<mark> In studying the effects of radiation exposure in humans, it isimportant to realize that the biological damage caused by a particle depends not only onthe total energy deposited but also on the rate of energy loss per unit distance traversed bythe particle (or “linear energy transfer”)</mark>.<mark> For example, alpha particles do much more damageper unit energy deposited than do electrons</mark>.<mark>Radiation effects and radiation dosesA traditional unit of human-equivalent dose is the rem, which stands for radiation equivalentin man</mark>.<mark>At low doses, such as what we receive every day from background radiation (< 1 m rem),the cells repair the damage rapidly</mark>.<mark> At higher doses (up to 100 rem), the cells might179MODULE - 4ContemporaryEnvironmental IssuesNotesEnvironmental Science Senior Secondary Coursenot be able to repair the damage, and the cells may either be changed permanentlyor die</mark>. Cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells whenthey divide and may become cancerous.At even higher doses, the cells cannot be replaced fast enough and tissues fail to function.An example of this would be “radiation sickness.<mark>” This is a condition that results after highdoses is given to the whole body (>100 rem)</mark>.<mark>Nuclear explosions and accidents in nuclear reactors are a serious source of radiationhazard</mark>. The effects of atomic explosions in Nagasaki and Hiroshima are still not forgotten.The nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl in 1986 led to deaths of many reactor personneland a very large release of radionuclide to the environment causing a long term radiationdamage to the people living in the neighboring regions.<mark>Accidents at nuclear power plantsNuclear fission in the reactor core produces lot of heat which if not controlled canlead to a meltdown of fuel rods in the reactor core</mark>. If a meltdown happens byaccident, it will release large quantities of highly dangerous radioactive materials inthe environment with disastrous consequences to the humans, animals and plants.To prevent this type of accidents and reactor blow up, the reactors are designed tohave a number of safety features.<mark>Inspite of these safety measures two disasters in the nuclear power plants arenoteworthy- namely at ‘Three Mile Island’ in Middletown (U</mark>.S.A.) in 1979, atChernobyl (U.S.<mark>S</mark>.R.) in 1986. In both these cases a series of mishaps and errorsresulted in over heating of the reactor core and lot of radiation was released into theenvironment. The leakage from Three Mile Island reactor was apparently low andno one was injured immediately. However, in case of Chernobyl the leakage wasvery heavy causing death of some workers and radiation spread over large areasscattered all over Europe. People of the city had to be evacuated to safer placesand the plant had to be closed down. These two disasters are a reminder thatnuclear power reactors require a constant up gradation of safety measures. Accidentswith nuclear submarines also points to the same.<mark>INTEXT QUESTIONS 10</mark>.51.
