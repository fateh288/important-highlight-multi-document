He fought the forces of evil with the straightforwardness and boldness of a missionary. His gifts were God- given. He was cut out by nature as the pre-appointed agent for great things. Few men can equal him in the absolute purity of character, consistency of principle and grim determination to see things through. He refused to be cowed down by any person.He clung to the last, little caring for the consequences, to what he considered to be right, morally and ethically. "I stand for truth; I fight for truth and I shall die for truth," said Subhas in one of his memorable speeches in Singapore. He did not fear even death. "I am immortal till my work is done", he used to say. May the soul of the mighty architect of India's liberation lead us and show us light in the country's moments of frustration, disappointment and dejection.
